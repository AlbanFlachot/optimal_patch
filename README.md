Scripts which were used to generate the anaylsis and figures for the study :

First, you will need to download the kernels activations when exposed to all the different stimuli.

These can be downloaded in https://www.dropbox.com/home/activations_to_optimal_patches. They should be downloaded as is, in a repository under the name pickles.

You can then just run the script ''patch_tuning_analysis_4k_Sat_all.py'' and it should generate the figures in a directory ''figures''.
