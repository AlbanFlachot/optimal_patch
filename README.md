Scripts which were used to generate the anaylsis and figures for the study : Color for object recognition: Hue and chroma sensitivity in the deep features of Convolutional Neural Networks

First, you will need to download the kernels activations when exposed to all the different stimuli.

These can be downloaded in https://www.dropbox.com/sh/02wltahzuhw8wh6/AACHX30TqAlg2vdbGFrc0q84a?dl=0. They should be downloaded as is, in a repository under the name pickles.

You can then just run the script ''patch_tuning_analysis_4k_Sat_all.py'' and it should generate the figures in a directory ''figures''.
